## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This project integrates three powerful technologies to build a full-stack Web3 marketplace:

| Layer          | Tech Stack        | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Frontend**   | `Next.js`         | Modern React-based frontend with SSR & API routes |
| **Backend**    | `Supabase`        | Auth, database, and instant APIs for user & product management |
| **Blockchain** | `Stellar`         | Fast, low-fee smart payments with asset support |

## 💳 Stellar Integration

This template uses **Stellar SDK** to:

* Create new trustlines and issue assets
* Build and submit payment operations
* Interact with wallet providers (e.g., Freighter, Albedo)

All Stellar-related logic is abstracted inside:

```ts
/lib/stellar/
  wallet.ts      // Handle wallet connections
  payments.ts    // Build/send operations
  assets.ts      // Trustlines and asset utilities
```

---

## 🧰 Supabase Integration

Supabase handles:

* 👥 **Users**: Auth and metadata
* 🗃 **Marketplace Data**: Listings, Orders, Ratings
* 🔐 **Policies**: Custom RLS rules for secure multi-tenant logic

You can manage all resources from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).
